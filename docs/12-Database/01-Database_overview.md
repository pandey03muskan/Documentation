   - **MongoDb** -  A document-oriented database.
   - **Postgresql** - A relational database that also supports key-value storage.
   - **Redis** -  A key-value store known for its exceptional speed in handling operations with key-value pairs.

   ## Choosing a database
   Selecting the right storage solution depends on your requirements for latency, durability, consistency, and various other factors.

   To assist you in making this decision, weâ€™ve provided a table below that summarizes the benefits of each storage option in relation to one another.
   

   |  Features  |  MongoDB                                                  |  PostgreSQL                                                 |  Redis                                              |
